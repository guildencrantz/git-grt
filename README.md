# grt

grt aims to unify git and [Gerrit Code Review](http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/)
by unifying gerrit commands into the git interface.

## History

grt was prototyped during the Spring 2014 hack-@-thon at Return Path with the
intention of helping simplify the workflow for developers sick of switching between
the git CLI and gerrit web page.

If quarterly hackathons and challenging problems sound interesting to you check
